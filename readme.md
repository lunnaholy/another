  <h3>Useless</h3>
  the most useless bot in the world
</div>

### Features
- Own message manager (Hear)
- Flexible command setting
- Has its own REST API for receiving data from third-party services (closed source)
- He's not so useless (unlike me lmao)

### Installation
First thing you need to do is install the dependencies. To do this, you can run the following command in the repository folder:
```bash
npm install
```
Then you need to create an auth.json file with the following content:
```json
{
    "token": "<your main bot instance>",
    "test": "<your test bot instance for local testing> <optional>"
}
```
Well, that's all. Now you can start the bot.

Default prefix: `u!`, you can change it in `/modules/Hear/hear.js` file.
